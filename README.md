# Customer Churn Analysis by-python-
This analysis examines telecom customer data, focusing on service usage, contract types, and customer demographics. By utilizing various data visualization techniques, we explore trends affecting customer retention and propose data-driven recommendations.

# Project Objective
- The objective of this project is to analyze customer churn patterns in a telecom company, identify key factors contributing to customer retention and churn, and provide actionable insights to reduce churn rates.

# Process
1) Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
- Replaced missing values with 0 where applicable (e.g., tenure of 0 with no total charges).
- Converted numerical binary values (e.g., Senior Citizen: 0/1) to categorical values (Yes/No) for better interpretability.

2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Overall Churn Rate: 26.54% of customers have churned.
- Demographic Insights: A higher percentage of senior citizens have churned compared to younger customers.
- Tenure Analysis: Customers with long-term usage are more likely to stay, while those using the service for just 1â€“2 months are more likely to leave.
- Contract Type: Month-to-month contract holders exhibit the highest churn rate compared to customers with one- or two-year contracts.
Service Influence:
- Fiber optic users experience a higher churn rate compared to DSL users.
- Customers who subscribed to security, backup, and tech support services have lower churn rates.
- Customers without internet services show the lowest churn rate.

3) Visualizations:
- Count plots and pie charts were used to depict churn distribution across different customer segments.
- Comparative bar charts highlighted trends across payment methods and service usage.
- Boxplots examined total charges and tenure in relation to churn behavior.

# Summary of Key Findings
- Churn Rate: 26.54% of customers have left the service.
- Senior Citizens: Higher churn rate compared to younger demographics.
- Tenure & Retention: Customers using services for a longer period tend to stay, while early adopters within the first few months are at high risk of leaving.
- Contract Type Impact: Month-to-month contracts have significantly higher churn rates compared to annual or biennial contracts.
Service Influence:
- Fiber optic users experience higher churn.
- Customers without internet services have the lowest churn rate.
- Customers with additional security, backup, and tech support services are more likely to stay.

# Outcome & Recommendations
- Improve Retention for New Customers: Implement loyalty programs or introductory offers to reduce early churn.
- Targeted Engagement for Senior Citizens: Develop personalized plans or offers tailored to older customers.
- Promote Long-Term Contracts: Encourage customers to opt for one- or two-year contracts by offering discounts.
- Service Bundling Strategy: Recommend security, backup, and tech support services to customers to improve retention.
- Optimize Internet Services: Investigate fiber optic service issues and explore ways to enhance customer experience.
